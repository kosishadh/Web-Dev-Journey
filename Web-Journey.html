          is <u> Koshu</u>. My student ID is <code>w2121985</code> and im really
          eager and excited to learn more and dive deeper into web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been fascinated by how websites work and the creativity
          involved in building them. Although I had minimal experience of
          coding, I am very excited to learn and develop web pages.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Module Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1<sup>st</sup>Expectation:</strong> I expect to gain a solid
          foundation in both HTML and CSS, understanding how to structure web
          pages properly and style them effectively. I want to be confident in
          creating semnatic, accessible websites that follow best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2<sup>nd</sup>Expectation:</strong> I hope to learn about
          resposive designa nd how to make websites that look great on all
          devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Understaning the
          principlesof modern web design is crucial in todays mobile first
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3<sup>rd</sup>Expectation:</strong> I am looking forward to
          understaning JavaScript and how it adds interactivity to websites. I
          want to be able to create dynamic, enagaging user experiences that bgo
          beyonf static pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What I learned today:</strong> Today I learned about tables
          for HTML. I also learned about &lt;tr &gt;(Table Row), &lt;th &gt;
          (Table Header) &lt;td &gt; (Table Description).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          As I reflect on what I learned today. I found some aspects that are
          more challenging than others. The most difficult part for me to
          understand was the styling of these tables. It is already common for
          me to take several attempts to get the wanted result from styling but
          this time it took a bit more tries.However, once I understood it
          started being easier and make more sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I reflect a bit more further, I realize that practicing
          repeatedly has helped me understand how HTML elements work together.
          Even though it was confusing at first, breaking the steps into smaller
          steps made it easier to manage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reflect that I am becoming more confident with basic HTML concept.
          Fixing mistake and writing structured codes have helped me understand
          how webpages are built and I feel more prepared to continue learning
          web devlopment.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I reflect on what I found interesting and surprising, I was
          amazed by how much control CSS gives us over the appearance of tables.
          It's interesting that simple HTML tables can be transformed into
          professional-looking data displays with just a few styling rules. I
          also found it fascinating how semantic HTML elements help organize
          content in a way that makes sense both visually and structurally.
